# Egyist-Website
This is a website for my debating discord server
Using Html5, CSS3, JS6, Bootstrap, Jquery for front end
Using NodeJS for backend with express framework
Used different packages to implement it.
Used along with a Discord Server Bot written in python used to fetch announcements from our discord and display it on website
